## Future Ideas/Work
> In the future, I plan to enhance the functionality of NewsExplorer by allowing users to click on a news card to open the full article in a new tab, improving the overall user experience. Additionally, while the current version uses a mocked backend for demonstration purposes, I intend to implement a fully functional backend using Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. This will allow for real user authentication, persistent article saving, and a more complete full-stack experience.
